This folder contains the code and models for the food detection program. The goal is to constantly poll the user's camera to see when food is on the screen. Once it finds food, it takes the photo and will then be sent for analysis.

Any .h5 or .keras file is a completed model that can be used to predict whether an image contains food or not.

The rest of the files contain the code for creating the model, testing the model, and utilizing the model.
